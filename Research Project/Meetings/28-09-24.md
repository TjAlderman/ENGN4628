Looks like linprog is not restricting motors to positive power generation? Yes, engine braking is a thing, but I think it's easier to make the simplification that we do not consider engine braking.

Can we break acceleration down into positive and negative, then use the deceleration term to charge the battery to mimic regenerative braking?

Mapping acceleration to power required?

Non-linear curves for power delivery of motors? Like a dyno curve. I think this is equivalent to the proposed 'efficiency curves', but it has a grounding in reality (as in we can justify curves based off dyno curves).

How can we incorporate friction and air resistance?
